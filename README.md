## My process

- For this project i styled for Mobile first with flexbox layout and then for the desktop design, i used grid to divide into 2 columns

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learnt how to use Css Grid to style the Desktop layout 
- I also learnt how to apply CSS reset!

### Continued development

I would like to refine and sharpen my skills in Grid and flexbox as i am still not comfortable on using those techniques well yet. I will also will love to know more on applying CSS reset to a style sheet

### Useful resources

- [Modern CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me in understanding the importance of CSS reset. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Css Grid Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itC4TxYMzFCfveyutyPOCY) - This is an amazing YouTube channel which helped me understand Grid with redefined insights. I highly recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
